# definite integration (approximation)
Python code for approximation of integrals by Riemann sum.
I have created a function definition with simple numpy functions and for loops. 
In order to use it, feed ave_riemann_sum with "lamba x: f(x), x_min, x_max, step".
For very good approximations make the step smaller than 0.01. I found step = 0.0001 to be a very good approximation.
